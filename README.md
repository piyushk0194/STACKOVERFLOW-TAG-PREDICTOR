# STACKOVERFLOW-TAG-PREDICTOR

Statement: (Multilabel Classification) A tag is a word or phrase that describes the topic of the question. Every question should have at least one tag, and can have up to five tags. Tags can be newly created by the user (if the user has reputation above 1500), or can be chosen from the list of tags available in the site. Tags help experts in finding the relevant questions that they can answer. Tags can also be used to find questions that are relevant or interesting to a user. Given this huge number of tags, it may be difficult for users to manually search appropriate tags while posting questions. Also, only users with good reputation can add new tags which in a way limit normal users from suggesting new tags
Since there are a huge number of tags, it is often a cumbersome process to search the correct tags. It may be useful to have an auto-tagging system that suggests tags to users depending on the content of the question.
